My rules:

I write it in Rust, even though I am already proficient in Rust. I set myself some additional rules to make it challenging:

- All solutions must be a single expression in a main function, as in no semicolons are allowed.
  - match expressions are not allowed either, as it is an easy cheat to just chain matches instead of using semicolon.
